Package unicode-math Warning: I'm going to overwrite the following commands
(unicode-math)                from the `mathtools' package: 
(unicode-math)                 
(unicode-math)                     \dblcolon, \coloneqq, \Coloneqq, \eqqcolon.

(unicode-math)                 
(unicode-math)                 Note that since I won't overwrite the other
(unicode-math)                colon-like commands, using them will lead to
(unicode-math)                inconsistencies.
